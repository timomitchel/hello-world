# hello-world
First github repository
Hello wizards,

My name is Timo, and I am looking to absorb as much information as possible in order to learn the fundamentals of computer science with a focus on data science. I live in Denver. Coffee is my bestie. People tend to make me laugh and I tend to stir laughter in them as well. I aim to make a positive impact on the world in order to enhance the human experience and the experience for all living things.
